## Welcome to my R portfolio!
Here, I showcase my projects and expertise in utilizing the R programming language for various data analysis and visualization tasks. Journey through my collection of projects demonstrating my skills and passion for leveraging R to derive meaningful insights from data. 

##
| Project Link | Project Focus | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| [Data Preparation and Customer Analytics](https://amichaelds.github.io/R/Quantium%20Virtual%20Internship/Task-1.html) | Data validation, Data visualisation, Data wrangling, Programming | Part 1 of the Quantium Virtual Internship. I conduct analysis on the client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations. |
| [Experiment and Uplift Testing](https://amichaelds.github.io/R/Quantium%20Virtual%20Internship/Task-2.html) | Data analysis, Commercial thinking, Statistical testing | Part 2 of the Quantium Virtual Internship. I identify benchmark stores that will allow me to test the impact of the new trial layouts on customer sales and provide data-driven recommendations on whether the new trial layout should be rolled out to all other stores. |
| [Module](https://anterusmichael.shinyapps.io/FirstShinyApps/) | Module development, Data visualization, Reactivity | Here, I showcase my ability to create an R Shiny application that utilizes reactivity to display data and graphs based on user input dynamically. |
| [Stock Information](https://anterusmichael.shinyapps.io/Stock-Information/) | Data retrieval, Data visualization, Reactivity | Here, I created an R Shiny application that dynamically displays stock prices in a graph using data from Yahoo Finance, allowing users to customize the displayed information by inputting stock symbols and dates |
| [Covid-19](https://anterusmichael.shinyapps.io/Covid-19-App/) | Data analysis, Data visualization, Reactivity, Predictive modelling | Here, I developed an R Shiny application that uses COVID-19 datasets to display information such as new confirmed and deceased cases at national and regional levels. Users can customize their analysis by selecting date ranges and multiple countries/regions. The app also incorporates predictive modelling based on historical data. |
